# Instructions

Symbol table is built in PascalParser.cpp

1. `make compile`
2. `./prog.out [filename]`
3. Parse Tree and Symbol Table output in test-out.txt
4. Note: Errors will be printed above the parse tree in the terminal
5. We intentionally left syntax and type errors in test-in.txt to make sure that
   the parser continues parsing.
